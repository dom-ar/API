## YouPoint | Youtube AI Summary API



A Python based API built with [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/). It provides API functions to gather information from YouTube videos using [youtube-transcript-api](https://pypi.org/project/youtube-transcript-api/) and [pytubefix](https://pypi.org/project/pytubefix/).  The gathered information is structured into a JSON format, which includes details from title and author to transcript and chapter lists. 

The JSON is provided to OpenAI to generate a summary and other video descriptions of the provided YouTube video based on a custom prompt. The OpenAI response including the summary and other video characteristics are returned by the API in a JSON format.
